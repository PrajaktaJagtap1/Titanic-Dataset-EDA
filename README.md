# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in survival rates using Python. It walks through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical insights that set the stage for future predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis
- Visualize survival trends based on key features
- Document insights and highlight actionable findings

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). It contains passenger information including demographics and survival status.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Analysis Highlights
- Data summary and missing value treatment
- Distribution of survival across gender, class, and age
- Correlation heatmap to assess feature relationships
- Insights for potential machine learning features

## 📈 Results
Women and children had higher survival rates, while third-class passengers faced the highest mortality. Fare and age also influenced survival probability.

## 🤖 Next Steps
This EDA lays the foundation for predictive modeling using Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.
